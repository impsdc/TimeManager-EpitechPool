# TimeManager - Epitech pool project MC1

## Project context

Rumors of strikes and resignations run, and the main union (CGT-U, which stands for City of Gotham TradeUnion) alerts the mayor and senior officials of the town hall of the urgency of the situation:

• employees complaining about the working conditions
• long shifts
• the deplorable state of the city
• Batman’s lack of scruples
• . . .

To calm the tensions, the town hall decides to make a state of play of the situation, and why not, to allow the municipal workers to have access to some days off to recuperate. For this, it needs to set up a time management application, that you will create.

Within the company, there are three categories of users:
• the employees
• the managers
• the general manager
